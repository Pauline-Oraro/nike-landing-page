This is a frontend project using **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS v4.1**, with custom utility classes defined directly in CSS (without a `tailwind.config.js` file). It includes a responsive layout and reusable padding utilities for consistency across sections.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without writing custom CSS from scratch.

Utility-first CSS is a styling approach where you build your designs by composing small, single-purpose CSS classes directly in your HTML or JSX.

A component in React is a reusable, independent piece of UI. Think of it like a building block. You can create a component for a: Button,Header, Card and Navbar.

Props (short for properties) are how you pass data into components.

Props make your components dynamic and reusable by allowing you to customize their behavior or content.

map() in React is used to render multiple components from an array of data. It  avoids repeating code for similar UI elements.
